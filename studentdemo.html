      <div class="name"><h1>MANAGER JOBS</h1>

Management jobs offer some of the most direct ways to take on more responsibility in many companies. 
People in management jobs focus on one thing: They manage the people below them to ensure that the work is being done properly.
There are management jobs in every profession and every industry, in large and small companies, and in nonprofit and for-profit organizations. 
Someone has to be in charge and provide oversight and direction to staff, no matter the size of the company.

<H2>How Management Jobs Work</H2>
The simplest way to understand what differentiates a management job from a non-managerial one is to look at the daily tasks of employees.<br> 
In general, management jobs are positions in which your job responsibility is to accomplish tasks through the work of others, rather than by doing the work yourself.<br> 
For example, a production manager at a factory does not operate one of the machines even though they may be better at that task than some of the machine operators.<br>  
A software development manager does not write lines of code even though they are capable of that task. That's because they're in management positions.<br> 
Think about a team leader, a lead iron welder, or a senior programmer. These are all positions that rank on an upper level in their area, but they're not considered management positions. <br> 
There may be times when they manage other people, but they're doing mostly the same work as the other workers in their group.<br> 
People in management jobs oversee the work of other employees.<br>
Management jobs are available across industries and companies, but exact duties vary.<br>
To become a manager, you generally have to demonstrate proficiency in the tasks the employees are performing and the ability to supervise and motivate people.<br><br>
